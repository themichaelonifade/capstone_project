# Data Integration Automation



### About the Project

As a data scientist with the TDI community, it was observed that the teamâ€™s manual process of merging application data was causing significant delays. With 10,000 applications coming in every day, the manual approach was declared inefficient. This project aims to change that.

### The Goal

The main goal here is to create an automated system using Bash scripting and GitHub Actions to handle the integration of all incoming application data. By automating the process, time would be saved and make it much easier to manage the large volumes of applications that come in every day.

### What It Does

* Automates Data Merging: Instead of manually merging datasets, the process happens automatically.
* Triggered by New Data: GitHub Actions detects when new data is available and starts the integration process.
* Scalable: This system is built to handle more data as the team grows.

### Tech Used

* Bash Scripting: For automating the integration.
* GitHub Actions: To trigger the automation whenever new data arrives
